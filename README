This is a Python adaptation of the refactoring example code in Martin Fowler's Refactoring (2nd Edition).  It is not a line for line adaptation, but should be very familiar to anyone who has seen the original code.

The code is intended for refactoring practice.  It is intentionally not good code.

A comprehensive set of tests has been added so you can jump right into the refactoring.
